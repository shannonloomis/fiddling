## 
## Overview

This report contains data for `r params$n` random data points, with lat/long surrounding the University of Chicago and some random values so we can make histograms and color in the dots on the map.  

The following table shows the raw data for all `r params$n` random points:


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(params$df, row.names = FALSE, 
      caption = "That's so random...")
```


##
## Histogram

The user was apparently interested in looking into parameter `r params$v` for some reason.  So we made a histogram of all the values for `r params$v`.

##
## Map

Parameter `r params$v` in random positions around U of C was so great that the user decided to zoom in on this very site.
